NBA 2023-24 Performance Analysis of the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks

This project is a data analysis project which compiled an SQLite database using data scraped from the NBA's official website using Python, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Pandas. The data was then analyzed on a Jupyter Notebook and used data visualization tools such as Matplotlib to create charts and gain relevant insights into the performance of both teams over the 2023-24 Regular Season and Playoffs. This was primarily a preliminary project to dip my feet into databases and analysis, and it was a challenge learning to use these tools for the first time. While the overall quality of the analysis is far from perfect, I really enjoyed spending time figuring things out on the way and being able to combine two different hobbies of mine. I'm looking forward to trying something like this again, but with more tools involved, such as Heatmaps through Seaborn or using cloud-computing services such as AWS to host databases.
